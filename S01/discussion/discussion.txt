# Generate SSH Key and add it to your GitHub account
	Step 1: Generate SSH Key
	1.Open Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux). 
	2. Run this command in the git bash/terminal:
		ssh-keygen
	3. When prompted:
		- Press Enter to save in the default location.
		- Press Enter two times to skip passphrase.
	4. After that the terminal will show the "key's randomart image"

	Step 2: Copy the Public Key
	1. In the same terminal enter the following command to copy the content of the ssh-key created:
	- For Windows
		cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
	- For Linux
		xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	- For Mac
		pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	2. No response will be seen in the terminal, but the command already copied the content in the clipboard.

	Step 3: Add SSH Key to GitHub
	1. Go to GitHub.
	2. Click your Profile photo (top-right).
	3. Go to Settings.
	4. Click SSH and GPG keys (located at the side menu).
	5. Click New SSH key.
		Add:
			- Title → e.g., My Laptop
			- Key → Paste your copied public key.
	6. Click Add SSH key.

	Step 4: Test the Connection (optional)
	1. In the same terminal run the command:
		ssh -T git@github.com
	2. If the ssh-key is successful added, you’ll see:
		"Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."

# Configure Global Git Username & Email
	1. In the same terminal, set your Git identity globally (applies to all repositories) by entering the following command:
		git config --global user.name "Your githun username"
		git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
	2. Verify if configured by running the command:
		git config --global --list

# Using Git Commands and Creating a Remote Repository
	Step 1: Open a terminal in the project folder.
		- For Windows
		    Right Click → Project Folder → Git Bash Here
		- For Linux
		    Right Click → Project Folder → Open in Terminal
		- For Mac
		    Open Terminal → Drag and drop Project Folder to terminal
	Step 2: Initialize a local git repository
		git init
	Step 3: Check Repository Status
		git status
			- This will possibly shows one the following:
				- Untracked files
				- Modified files
				- Files ready to commit
	Step 4: Stage the files in preparation for creating a commit.
		1. Add a specific file:
			git add filename.ext
		2. Add all files:
			git add .
		3. Files should now be in “staged” status when "git status" is issued again.
	Step 5: Create a commit.
		1. First Commit or For a brand-new repository, the standard message is:
			git commit -m "Initial commit"
				Note: This indicates the first saved version of the project.
		2. Subsequent Commits or for all next commits:
				- Keep the message short
				- Make it clear and descriptive
				-  Use present tense (e.g., Add, Fix, Update, not Added, Fixed)
				
				Examples:
					git commit -m "Add login form validation"
					git commit -m "Fix navbar alignment issue"
	Step 6: Create a Remote Repository on GitHub
		1. Go to GitHub and log in.
		2. Click the + button (top-right corner) → New repository.
		3. Enter the following details:
			- Repository name → e.g., my-project
			- Description → optional short description
			- Visibility → Public or Private
		4. Do not select “Initialize with a README” (if you already have a local repository).
		5. Click Create repository.
	Step 7: Copy the SSH Key of the Remote Repository
		1. Under Quick Setup, click "SSH" and copy the clone url to connect the local repository to the remote repository.
		2. Next, go to the terminal and connect the local repository to the remote repository through the copied url
	Step 8:Add Remote Repository
		1. Add remote origin:
			git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
		2. git remote -v
	Step 9: Upload the local repository to a remote repository.
		1. In your local project, make sure to untracked and uncommit changes.
		2. Use the command
			git push origin master

				Notes:
					- "push" is a term used uploading the local repository to the remote repository.
					- origin refers to the added remote repository
					- master refers to a branch or a snapshot of your project.
	Note: For any changes for the project folder, follow steps 5 to 9.
